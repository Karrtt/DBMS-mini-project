Bank Management System

This projects aims to implement a Bank Management System which can be used to manage the data stored inside a bank. Initially the bank manager logs into their bank with their bank code and password. Upon login, the system allows for the bank to store and display details of its branches as well as the accounts it manages. Additionally, the application can be used to store customer details and the accounts they own. The user can delete entries from the table by specifying the corresponding id for the record and clicking delete. 

An option to run a sql query inside the application is also added as part of the project.(not recommended due to safety reasons)

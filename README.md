Bank Management System
This projects aims to implement a Bank Management System which can be used to manage the data stored inside a bank. Initially the bank manager logs into their bank with their bank code and password. Upon login, the system allows for the bank to store details of its branches as well as the accounts it manages. Additionally, the application can be used to store customer details and the accounts they own. The user can delete entries from the table by specifying the corresponding id for the record and clicking delete.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79457820/214831203-75ca29c3-9488-4466-a999-781f5234cb37.png)
